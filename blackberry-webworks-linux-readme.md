BlackBerry 10 WebWorks for Linux
================================

This is my on going project of keeping the BlackBerry 10 webworks platform compatable with linux. BlackBerry makes all the SDK's avalabe to linux but webworks, so thats where i come in and fill that gap. I am doing this project by my self and on my free time and any help would be great and feedback is always great.

**Requirements**

*	[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)
*	[Openjdk](http://openjdk.java.net/)
*	[Node](http://nodejs.org)

> BlackBerry will only support the other sdk's if you are using Ubuntu, so if you plan one using the [Blackberry NDK](http://developer.blackberry.com/native/) and may need support i would suggest Ubuntu. This will run on most linux distros the way it is. I do all my work on [Debian](http://debian.org).
